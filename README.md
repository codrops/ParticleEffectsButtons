## Basic usage

The `Particles` library depends on [anime.js](http://animejs.com/) to perform animations, so you need to include it before `Particles`.

Then you can start disintegrating/integrating things like:

```html
<!-- Normal HTML element to disintegrate -->
<button class="button">Button</button>

<script src="anime.min.js"></script>
<script src="dist/particles.min.js"></script>
<script>
    // Initialize a new instance of Particles to disintegrate/integrate the button
    var particles = new Particles('.button');

    // Disintegrate the button into particles
    particles.disintegrate();

    // particles.integrate(); // would do the opposite
</script>
```

## Options

For customization, you can pass `options` to `Particles` constructor. That `options` will override the default values, and will be used for any future operation (`disintegrate` or `integrate`). You can also override the `options` for a specific operation. Here is the complete list of `options` available:

| Name                         | Type                    | Default                    | Description |
|------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|-------------|
|`canvasPadding`               | `Integer`               | `150`                      | Padding for the generated `canvas` that will be positioned right behind the target element. A `canvasPadding = 0` will cause the `canvas` and the target element to have the same dimensions. |
|`duration`                    | `Integer`               | `1000`                     | Duration (`ms`) to perform the animations of target element and particles. |
|`easing`                      | `String` or `Function`  | `easeInOutCubic`           | Easing function to perform the animation of target element. It will be passed directly to `anime.js`. |
|`type`                        | `String`                | `circle`                   | Type of particle. Could be any of the following values: `circle`, `rectangle`, `triangle` |
|`style`                       | `String`                | `fill`                     | Style of particle. Could be any of the following values: `fill`, `stroke`. |
|`direction`                   | `String`                | `left`                     | Direction to start disintegrating the element. Could be any of the following values: `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom`. The opposite `direction` will be used to perform the `integrate` operation. |
|`size`                        | `Float` or `Function`   | Random from `1` to `4`     | Size (`px`) for particles. |
|`speed`                       | `Float` or `Function`   | Random from `-2` to `2`    | Pixels per frame that a particle will be moved. It could be a `function` to set it randomly per particle (as default value). |
|`color`                       | `String`                | Target's `background-color`| Color used to fill the particles. |
|`particlesAmountCoefficient`  | `Float`                 | `3`                        | A coefficient to calculate the amount of particles to animate. A `particlesAmountCoefficient = 0` will result in `0` particles, while bigger values will increase the amount of particles. |
|`oscilationCoefficient`       | `Float`                 | `20`                       | A coefficient to calculate the oscilation of particles while animating. A `oscilationCoefficient = 0` will result in no oscilation (straight movements), while bigger values will increase the oscilation, resulting in a kind of randomness. |
|`begin`                       | `Function`              | `undefined`                | Execute a function at the beginning of the animation. |
|`complete`                    | `Function`              | `undefined`                | Execute a function at the end of the animation. |
